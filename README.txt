Hello!

The following are comments and instructions for running the .py file

Sudoku.py - Simply double click the .py file to open the command line. You will be given an unsolved puzzle and prompted
to enter row, and column coordinates for your solution entries. Once the puzzle is complete, the program will check your
solution for correctness before ending the game.

Note: While the game will prevent the user from entering certain invalid inputs, it does not prevent the user from
entering incorrect integers outside of the 1 - 9 range, it is up to the user to understand those rules!

Remember the rules:
1. Each row must contain the numbers 1 - 9 with no repeated values
2. Each column must contain the numbers 1 - 9 with no repeated values
3. Each square must contain the numbers 1 - 9 with no repeated values

If you do not wish to play the game, and simply wish to test the solution checker, please open the code in pycharm and
 alter the commented out test code in the main section, or manipulate the test code as you see fit!

Wishing you well,

James Tauzin
